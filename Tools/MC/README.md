# tools usage
Firstly, convert files into ROOT tree format. Either from xAOD or other
format. Try to produce unified interface( fixed var number, type ...)
Then, apply cuts to the tree variables using the cut code.
After that, we can extract needed histograms from the cuted tree files,
and draw a better plot with Oneplot tools.
